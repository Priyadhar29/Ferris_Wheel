# 🎡 CSS Animation — Ferris Wheel

This project recreates a Ferris wheel animation using only **HTML** and **CSS**. It demonstrates CSS transforms, `@keyframes` animations, `transform-origin`, and how to make elements move smoothly and responsively without JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** — semantic markup for the wheel and gondolas  
- **CSS3** — layout, transforms, animations, and responsive styling  
- CSS properties used: `@keyframes`, `transform`, `transform-origin`, `animation`, `box-shadow`, `border-radius`

---

## ✨ Features
- Continuous Ferris wheel rotation using CSS `@keyframes`
- Independent gondola rotation so seats stay upright
- Responsive sizing so the wheel scales across devices
- No JavaScript — pure CSS animation

---

## ✅ What I Learned
- Creating smooth, continuous animations with `@keyframes`
- Using `transform-origin` to rotate elements around a specific point
- Combining parent and child transforms to achieve complex motion (wheel rotates, gondolas counter-rotate)
- Designing responsive animated components with scalable units
